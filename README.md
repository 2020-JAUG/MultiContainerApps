### You have a Makefile to assign the commands to use
<br>

* * This command is to raise the containers and using the -d flag for the detach mode `$ docker-compose up -d` we will use:
<br>
    - `$ make up`
<br>

 * This command is to close our containers `$ docker-compose down` we will use:
<br>
    - `$ make down`
